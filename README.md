# Image Enhancement Techniques

This repository contains a group assignment submitted for **ENGG*6302: Image Processing** at the University of Guelph. The project explores a variety of classical image enhancement techniques.

## Key Features

- Implementation and analysis of image processing techniques on 2D grayscale medical images (e.g., MRI scans)
- Histogram analysis and intensity profiling
- Application of spatial domain filters:
  - Average filtering
  - Median filtering
  - Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) for contrast enhancement
- Histogram equalization for contrast improvement
- Frequency domain filtering:
  - Low-pass filtering
  - High-pass filtering
- Noise modeling and removal:
  - Salt & Pepper noise
  - Gaussian noise
- Edge detection using:
  - Sobel operator
  - Prewitt operator
  - Canny edge detection
  - Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)
- Performance comparison of filters and edge detectors under noisy conditions
